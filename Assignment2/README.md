## Reflection and Peer Feedback

More progress on my first website!

I had a lot of fun bringing this togther. I feel it looks more coherent now and flows better. The boxes and image help break up the page. I enjoyed learning how to add hyperlinks my page aswell. The image took a moment to figure out, especially since I wanted it in a certain place and style. 

I didn't get any feedback on my project from last discussion, but I made tiny adjustments to my liking. Such as color tweaks, font size changes, and adjusting some of the card colors or opacity. 

At this moment I feel a little swamped in life because of some major changes (job and moving), but I think in general terms of this class and this module, I think I am doing okay! Although there was some hiccups there were quite simple fixes (need to adjust wording, add forgotten symbols, and fixing where things are being pulled.
