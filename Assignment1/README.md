## Reflection and Peer Feedback

The first piece of feedback I added into my work is scalling the font size up, specifically for the Act titles and the paragraphs. The second piece of feedback I incorported (and what took up most of my time) was colored boxes around my paragraphs.

These were already concerns of mine after doing the first draft. So it felt natural to make thos changes. I wanted especially to add the boxes around the paragraphs to add more visual appeal and to help guide the eye better. In general I still think it looks off but I am only begining and although looks simple this is where my general level of coding is at at the moment~
